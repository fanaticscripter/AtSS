# AtSS â€” Against the Storm Save Scummer

A small utility to streamline save scumming for [Against the Storm](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336490/Against_the_Storm/), which officially doesn't support that.

## What's supported

- Tested to work with the Steam version of the game on Windows.

- Back up your game save at any point, with an optional note (similar to save titles in other games).

- Restore backed up saves at any point. An auto backup of the save to be overwritten is created before each restore.

- Delete backed up saves.

- Open the saves directory (typically `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Eremite Games`) for manual operations. The game saves are in a folder there called `Against the Storm`, whereas our backups are saved in a separate folder called `Against the Storm - AtSS Backups` so that they aren't synced to Steam Cloud.

- If you're used to the command line, you can use subcommands to skip the main menu. See `AtSS --help`.

## What's not supported

- Non-Steam and/or non-Windows versions of the game.

- Multiple profiles or Queen's Hand Trials. I've been playing exclusively with the main profile, and I haven't bothered to try Queen's Hand Trials (might be a bit too tedious for my taste if they are more difficult than P20).

- No tech support. You can tell me about issues, but I don't promise to respond or solve your problems. I'm just sharing something I wrote for myself, and it already works well enough for me.

## Recommendations

- You're encouraged to install [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) and [set it as your default terminal application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/startup#default-terminal-application). I'm not sure the legacy console handles colors correctly.
